        # üõë **STOP! Do not create public security issues.**
        
        ## Security vulnerabilities should NEVER be reported publicly
        
        Please report security vulnerabilities through one of these private channels:
        
        ### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Recommended)
        1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository
        2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
        3. Fill out the private security advisory form
        
        ### Option 2: Email
        Send details to: **security@braincraft.io**
        
        ### Why This Matters
        Creating public issues for security vulnerabilities puts all users at risk by exposing attack vectors before fixes are available.

        **If you proceed with creating this issue, it will be immediately closed and deleted for security reasons.**
