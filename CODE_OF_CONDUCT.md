# BrainCraft.io Code of Conduct

BrainCraft.io is dedicated to providing a **safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment** for all members of our open source community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for everyone participating in BrainCraft.io projects and spaces, as well as steps for reporting incidents and enforcing the rules. Our goal is to foster an environment where people of all backgrounds and experience levels can collaborate, contribute, and feel that they **belong**.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders **pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, inclusive, **accessible**, and healthy community. We are committed to **fostering a culture of respect, empathy, and collaboration** so that all participants feel safe and welcome.

## Our Standards

**Expected Behavior:** Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating **empathy and kindness** toward others
* Being respectful of **differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences**
* Giving and gracefully accepting **constructive feedback**
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes, and **learning from the experience**
* Focusing on what is best not just for individuals, but for the **overall community**
* Approaching disagreements or conflicts **constructively and without blame or shame**, focusing on understanding and resolving issues together
* Using inclusive language and **prioritizing accessibility** in our communications and project design, so that our community is open to people of all abilities and needs

**Unacceptable Behavior:** Examples of behavior that will **not** be tolerated include:

* The use of **sexualized language or imagery**, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind
* **Trolling**, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private **harassment** of any kind
* Publishing others’ **private information** (such as a physical or email address) without explicit permission (doxxing)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered **inappropriate in a professional setting** or that violates our standards of respect and inclusion

Please note that this Code of Conduct is *not exhaustive*. It serves to capture our common understanding of a **productive, collaborative environment**, and we expect all community members to follow it in **spirit as well as in letter**.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The **BrainCraft.io Maintainers** team (the community leaders) is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair **corrective action** in response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to **remove, edit, or reject** comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. The Maintainers are also empowered to ban temporarily or permanently any community member for behaviors that violate this Code.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies **within all community spaces** managed by the BrainCraft.io organization, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official BrainCraft.io email address or social media account, or acting as an official representative at an online or offline event. Participants who violate this Code of Conduct in any BrainCraft.io project space or **in the context of community representation** may face consequences as outlined below.

## Reporting Issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior **may be reported to the BrainCraft.io Maintainers team**, who are responsible for Code of Conduct enforcement. You can report issues by contacting the Maintainers via email at **[conduct@braincraft.io](mailto:conduct@braincraft.io)**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated **promptly and fairly**, with respect for the privacy and security of the reporter.

When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible, including: who is involved (names or usernames of the persons), a description of the concerning behavior or incident, where and when it occurred, and any available supporting evidence (such as screenshots or links). **All reports will be kept confidential** to the extent possible, and we will only disclose information on a need-to-know basis to investigate and resolve the issue.

**Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.** If a community member engages in harassing or otherwise unacceptable behavior, the Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary or permanent ban from the community.

## Enforcement Process

Community leaders (the BrainCraft.io Maintainers) will follow these **Community Impact Guidelines** in determining the consequences for any violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Minor issues—such as the use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written **warning** from the Maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. The offender is expected to stop the problematic behavior immediately and correct it going forward. *A public apology may be requested if appropriate.*

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single significant incident or a series of actions.

**Consequence:** A **formal warning** from the Maintainers, along with an outline of consequences if the behavior continues. The warned person may be required to avoid future interaction with the people involved, including avoidance of unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This means refraining from interactions in community spaces as well as external channels related to the community. Violating these terms may lead to further action, such as a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or a significant disruption to the community.

**Consequence:** A **temporary ban** from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. During this period, the offending individual is expected to disengage and not participate in any community activities or spaces. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with Maintainers or other community members, is allowed during the ban. Violation of these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of repeated violation of community standards, or a severe violation (such as evidence of harassment, discrimination, or aggression) that makes it clear the individual is not willing or able to conform to the Code of Conduct.

**Consequence:** **Permanent expulsion** from the community. The individual will no longer be permitted to participate in any BrainCraft.io project spaces or activities, and no further interactions will be allowed.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, as well as from policies of other open source communities. The **Community Impact Guidelines** for enforcement are inspired by Mozilla’s Code of Conduct Enforcement Ladder. This document also reflects values of empathy, inclusion, and **positive conflict resolution** drawn from community best practices. We thank the open source community (including CNCF, Apache, Linux Foundation, Kubernetes, and Microsoft Open Source) for their examples and leadership in establishing respectful, inclusive community norms.
