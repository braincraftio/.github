# Governance

This document outlines the governance structure and decision-making processes for the BrainCraft.io organization.

## Decision Making

BrainCraft.io follows a collaborative decision-making model that balances community input with maintainer expertise.

### Consensus Model

We strive for consensus on all major decisions through:
1. **Proposal**: Ideas are proposed via GitHub Issues or Discussions
2. **Discussion**: Community members provide feedback and suggestions
3. **Refinement**: Proposals are updated based on input
4. **Decision**: Maintainers make final decisions considering community feedback

### Decision Types

**Minor Decisions** (bug fixes, documentation updates):
- Can be made by any maintainer
- Should follow existing patterns and standards
- Require one approving review

**Major Decisions** (new features, breaking changes):
- Require discussion in GitHub Issues/Discussions
- Need approval from at least two maintainers
- Should consider community impact
- May require a comment period (typically 7 days)

**Strategic Decisions** (new projects, major direction changes):
- Require consensus among all active maintainers
- Must include community consultation period
- Should be documented in organization-wide announcements
